# Cloudbursting-Stock-Runtime-Library

The Cloudbursting Stock Runtime Library

Cloudbursting Stock is a mature-themed IT ad design marketing group that emphasizes startup and emerging cloud clients. The group also hosts cloud based mockups and sample packages for graphic designer resources.

The mainframe for this application consists of a Directory of Components, which is a collection of runtime components which are used by the end user to view, call or refactor content embedded within the larger component. A 'Runtime' is a complete, working app based upon the major theme of its directory component. Each runtime is stored in a virtual library and wrapped in either a Python (console runtime) or JavaScript (CGI runtime) wrapper. End user triggers either print the output on screen (print routines), parse the library for scripts (access routines) or build new runtimes (mockup routines).

Cloudbursting Stock Component Interface Developer Kit (CID)
Each DOC component is built upon a C# interface module which allows relative passage of variables and commands. This environment is known as the Component Interface Developer Kit, a collection of libraries that hosts tools and toolsets used to print, access and mockups for runtimes.


Cloudbursting Stock Cloud Browser Application
The stock libraries in the CID kit are accessible using the Cloud Browser Application (CBA), which is an automated extension of various popular browsers to host CID and DOC runtimes. Developers use the CBA to view layouts for mockups, networking and enterprise class functions before packaging finished projects for the end user.
